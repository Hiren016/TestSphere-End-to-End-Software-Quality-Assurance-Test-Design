# 🧪 TestSphere — End to End Software Quality Assurance & Test Design

**Technologies / Techniques:**  
Manual Testing, IEEE 829 Test Documentation, Test Case Design, Defect Tracking, MS Excel, Jira, Code Collab

---

## 📝 Project Description

**TestSphere** is a comprehensive manual software testing project focused on structured test planning, systematic test case design, and end-to-end defect management. The project strictly follows **IEEE 829-2008 testing standards** and simulates real-world QA workflows using a web-hosted application tested on **Code Collab**.

This project demonstrates complete **quality assurance ownership**, covering requirement analysis, test design, execution, defect lifecycle management, and traceability — ensuring transparency and documentation across the entire testing lifecycle.

## ❓ Problem Statement

Software applications often fail due to:

- ❌ **Incomplete test coverage** — Missing edge cases and requirement gaps  
- ❌ **Poor defect documentation** — Scattered tracking without proper categorization  
- ❌ **Lack of standardized test planning** — Inconsistent testing approaches  
- ❌ **No requirement traceability** — Inability to map tests back to requirements  

**TestSphere addresses these challenges** by implementing a disciplined QA framework with IEEE-standard documentation, structured defect tracking, and full requirement traceability.

## 🔧 Testing Activities Performed

### 1️⃣ IEEE-Compliant Test Plan Development

📋 Created a comprehensive **IEEE 829-compliant Test Plan** covering:

- Test scope, objectives, and deliverables  
- Test strategy (functional, integration, system testing)  
- Resource allocation, schedule, and timelines  
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies  
- Entry and exit criteria for each test phase  
- Test environment and infrastructure setup  

✅ **100% compliance with IEEE 829-2008 standards**

---

### 2️⃣ Test Case Design & Verification

✍️ Designed **150+ structured test cases** using:

- **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA):** Boundary input validation  
- **Equivalence Partitioning:** Valid and invalid input grouping  
- **Decision Table Testing:** Complex business logic validation  
- **State Transition Testing:** Workflow and state change verification  

📑 Created a **Test Case Verification Document** including:

- Peer review checklist  
- Requirement coverage analysis  
- Test case completeness validation  
- Approval workflow and sign-offs  

🎯 **Achieved 98% requirement coverage**

---

### 3️⃣ Defect Tracking & Management

🗄️ Designed a **centralized defect tracking database** with fields:

- Defect ID, Title, Description, Steps to Reproduce  
- Severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)  
- Priority (P0, P1, P2, P3)  
- Status (New, Assigned, In Progress, Fixed, Retest, Closed, Reopened)  
- Module, Environment, Browser, OS details  
- Assigned To, Reporter, Logged Date, Resolved Date  
- Attachments (screenshots, logs, videos)  

📊 Implemented a complete **defect lifecycle workflow**  
📈 Generated defect metrics and reports:

- Defect density per module  
- Defect aging & resolution time analysis  
- Severity and priority distribution  
- Root cause analysis summaries  

---

### 4️⃣ Requirement Traceability

🔗 Created **bi-directional Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM)** mapping:

- Requirements → Test Cases  
- Test Cases → Defects  
- Requirements → Defects  

✅ Ensured **complete traceability** across all testing phases

---
